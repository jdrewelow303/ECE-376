RGB LED color matching game

An LCD display gives players a prompt to start the game and then displays each players score after each of the three rounds. For each round, one LED will cycle through the color spectrum while the other LED is initialized to a random color. Each player presses their button when they think the color of the LEDs best match. Each players score is calculated as the difference between the RGB values of the two LEDs at the time they pressed their button. If the player doesn't press their button within a given time, the player is given a worst case score as a foul. At the end of the three rounds, The LCD display will display which player had the lower score and give the players the option to restart the game.
